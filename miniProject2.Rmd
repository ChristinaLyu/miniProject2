## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r percentage}
joined <- 
  committees %>%
  left_join(contributions, by = "cmte_id")

group_id <-
  joined %>%
  group_by(cmte_id, cmte_state) %>%
  summarise(
    amount = n(),
         same = sum(ifelse(state == cmte_state, 1, 0)),
         diff = amount - same)


```

```{r}
group_id %>%
  filter(!is.na(same)) %>%
  group_by(cmte_state) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(amount),
         inState = sum(same),
         outState = sum(diff), 
         percentageIn = inState / total, 
         percentageOut = outState / total)
```

```{r amount}
percentage <- 
  joined %>%
  group_by(cmte_state) %>%
  mutate(sum = sum(transaction_amt))

percentageIn <- 
  percentage %>%
  filter(cmte_state == state) %>%
  mutate(sumIn = sum(transaction_amt),
         percentageIn = sumIn / sum) %>%
  select(cmte_state, sum, sumIn, percentageIn)

percentageOut <- 
  percentage %>%
  filter(cmte_state != state) %>%
  mutate(sumOut = sum(transaction_amt),
         percentageOut = sumOut / sum) %>%
  select(cmte_state, sum, sumOut, percentageOut)
```
